prerequisits:
-git
-docker

copy the code files
```
git clone https://github.com/DepictYourself/scaling-octo-dollop.git
```

change into directory
```
cd scaling-octo-dollop
```

start with docker compose
(I have docker compose version 2. so I believe that is the reason why I have to use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose up`
```
docker compose up
```

I hope everything build correctly.
After the containers start, you should be able to visit `http://localhost:4200`
